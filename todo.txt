Trial
    -clfs and clf_times not working?

to make:
    -add more logging
    -rejection sampler
        -test accuracy vs normal subsampling
    -script to call libFM
    -elm transform(n_hidden, activation function)
        -elm transform with l1 feature selection (pruning)
    greedy feature removal
        -loop to find worst feature, repeat until CV score stops improving
    -exploration
    -feature creation file
        -update generic_feature_creation to use num->cat and cat->num
        -create function for creating features from a list of dates
            -start time
            -length
            -end time
            -number of occurences
            -avg time between occurences
            -max time between occurences
            -min time between occurences
            -etc ?
        -text features
            -convert to ascii then do the ff:
            -% of each letter
            -length
            -num words
            -num capital
            -avg word length
            -% not alnum (minus spaces)
            -% digit
            -% letters
        -use sklearn.semi_supervised for imputation
    -spearmint-lite wrapper
        -ability to record all runs for visualization / analysis (use sqlite)
        -ability to add / remove runs manually
        -compile with Cython
        -plot function that shows heat map for each pair of hyperparameters
    -par_quick_save / par_quick_load / par_quick_write
    -qsave / qload / qsave / qload / qwrite / qread (no need directory)
    -s* for storage, which saves/loads to a settings directory
    -python msda
